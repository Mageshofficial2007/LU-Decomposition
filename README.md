# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation. 
2.Prepare the lists from each linear equations and assign in np.array().
3.Using the scipy.linalg.solve(),and import lu decomposition,we can find the solutions.
4.End the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
/*

```
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```
/*

```

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
